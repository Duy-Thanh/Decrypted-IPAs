# Decrypted-IPAs

- Sometimes, I decrypt apps for research purposes. There is no reason to delete them, so I put them here. I DO NOT decrypt paid apps, so don't ask. 

- App Thinning is disabled.

- All iPAs are fresh, **which means no modifications or tweaks injected**. 

- Most iPAs are decrypted by [frida-ios-dump](https://github.com/AloneMonkey/frida-ios-dump). I also use [iridium](https://moreinfo.thebigboss.org/moreinfo/depiction.php?file=iridiumDp) sometimes (bigger file's size).
